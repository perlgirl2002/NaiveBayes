       "265    Well, I guess I'm the fly in this reviewer ointment, but Dave's is the only hotsauce that I won't buy. It has a synthetic quality to it and a flavor that is almost non-existent. This is due to its being made directly from capsaicin extract as opp...\n",
       "270    O.k., I'm going to offer a counterpoint to all the positive reviews.  I did not like this hot sauce, and I like hot sauce!  This may be good in chili (and I will try it there as soon as I get a chance), but it is not a general hot sauce for your ...\n",
       "290    I just tried this sauce moments ago. Someone had brought some in to work and it was being passed around. I love hot food, so I figured I might as well try it. I have not explored any exotic peppers or sauces - just the usual jalapeno, habanero, c...\n",
